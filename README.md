This plug-in has been deprecated due to it conflicting with an existing mootools method "highlight" applied to the Element class.

Please see [Elements.MultiFade](http://mootools.net/forge/p/elementsmultifade) instead of using this plugin.

I intend to remote this plugin, but do not see a removal option...
